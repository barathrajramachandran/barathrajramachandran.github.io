    <p>Bio: Passionate Backend Developer | Architecting Scalable Solutions & Building Robust APIs</p>
  <p>I specialize in designing and developing high-performance, scalable backend systems using technologies like Java, Spring Boot and various database architectures. With a focus on clean, efficient code and performance optimization, I build robust APIs, microservices, and integrate complex data systems to power seamless user experiences.
    Always eager to learn and stay on top of emerging technologies, I am committed to delivering clean, maintainable code that drives real-world impact. When I’m not coding, I’m diving deep into new frameworks, exploring cloud technologies, and collaborating with others to solve challenging technical problems.</p>
